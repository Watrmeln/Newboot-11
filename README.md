#What is Newboot?
Newboot is a tool I made to replace windows 11's boot animation with the new circle one. NO MORE SPINNY DOTS!

Newboot is written entirely in windows Batch script, with help from Stack overflow of course

#Why is Newboot?
I wanted to make a way to quickly, harmlessly, and easily make a way for normies who think regedit is scary and people who just want simple to activate the new boot animation on their Windows 11 systems.
